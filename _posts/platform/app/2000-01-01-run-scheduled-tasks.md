{% include upon_request.md %}

Your application may need to execute some tasks at regular interval. The cron feature is here to help you run scheduled tasks based on [one-off containers]({% post_url platform/app/2000-01-01-tasks %}).

Instead of running 24/7 a container to execute a task from time-to-time, the cron feature lets you start one-off containers only when you need.

TBD how is it enabled

## Configuring Cron Tasks on Your Application

Configure cron tasks on your application by adding a `cron.json` file at the root of your application. The file will be detected at the next deployment and the cron task will be configured for your application.

For instance, here is a file example of how to schedule a task every 10 minutes to execute the command `rails orders:check` on a 2XL container:

```json
{
  "jobs": [
    {
      "command": "*/10 * * * * rails orders:check",
      "size": "2XL"
    }
  ]
}
```

Each job is configured as a JSON object with two keys:
- `command`: contains both the cron expression and the command to execute:
  - The cron expression follows the [crontab standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron#CRON_expression). You may find the website [crontab.guru](https://crontab.guru/#*/10_*_*_*_*) useful to write your own cron expression.
  - The command is any command you can execute in a one-off container (i.e. with the command `scalingo --app my-app run <command>`).
- `size`: specify the [container size]({% post_url platform/internals/2000-01-01-container-sizes %}) of the one-off container executing the command. This key is optional, it defaults to M (512 MiB RAM).

## Get Configured Cron Tasks

Get the list of tasks configured on your application using the Scalingo CLI:

```
scalingo --app my-app cron-tasks
+--------------------------+------+
|         COMMAND          | SIZE |
+--------------------------+------+
| */10 * * * * echo biniou |      |
+--------------------------+------+
```

### How To Enable Cron Tasks?

HOW TO 

### How To Disable Cron Tasks?

You may want to disable automatic cron tasks execution, for example for [review apps]({% post_url
platform/app/2000-01-01-review-apps %}) or staging environments.

### How Precise Is The Cron Feature?

TBD disclaimer about precision and other solutions

### How Will I Be Billed?

The cron feature in itself is free. The one-off containers launched to run the commands defined in your cron tasks will be like other [one-off containers]({% post_url platform/app/2000-01-01-tasks %}) ie you will be billed for the type of container you defined in you cron task (M is the default container size) for the time it was executed. For example of you cron task ran during 5 minutes, you will be billed 5 minutes of an M container.
